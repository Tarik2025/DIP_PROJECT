# 🖼️ DIP_PROJECT – Image to Cartoon & Anime Style Converter (MATLAB)

This project is developed as part of the **Digital Image Processing (DIP)** course and demonstrates how standard image processing techniques in MATLAB can be used to convert normal images into **cartoon-style** and **anime-style** art.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This MATLAB-based tool applies a combination of:

- **Canny Edge Detection**
- **Color Quantization**
- **Laplacian Filtering**

to create visually stylized versions of any input image, without using deep learning. Users are prompted to upload an image, which is then processed and displayed in cartoon-like and anime-like formats.
